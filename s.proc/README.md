# XML2JS 
This is intended to convert XML and JSON purely within a Snowflake Stored Procedure. Given time constraints the project has been put on hold. Contribute as you see fit.


The lib/project uses the following JS lib which does not depend on any external libraries to run since Snowflake does not allow the importing of JS (or other language) libraries.
